# Weekend Labratory

These are just some expiriments and fun projects I try to write each weekend to suck less. Some of these will be written & designed from scratch, some assets may be used from other sources (with proper respect to credit & licensing), some of these will be from following tutorials. I'll do my best to document which ones are which.

## Goal

The goal is really just to play with the technologies that have not come up through work.

### Schedule

As much as I would love to say **EACH AND EVERY** weekend this will be updated--I've got the focus of a small infantile rodent sooo there may be periods of time where nothing gets made. Unfortunate, but I don't want to feel like I've failed for missing a week when nothing is at stake soo yeah....

        <td>10/27/2013</td>
        <td>HTML5 Canvas + JS movement engine. I tried to abstract the logic out for making a game with a world, a player that moves as the world turns by queing events through a timer. Mostly successful aside from handling rotation. Will expiriment with rotation another week.</td>
